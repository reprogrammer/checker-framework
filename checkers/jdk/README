This directory contains annotated versions of library classes (such as the
JDK).

See chapter "Annotating libraries" in the Checker Framework manual for
information on using these classes.

Some generated .jar files are checked into the repository, because
generating them requires external dependencies (the Annotation File
Utilities) and because it prevents bugs related to different people using
different versions of the JDK.

If you annotate more library classes -- in the JDK or another library --
please share them with us via email at checker-framework-dev@googlegroups.com.
Thanks!
