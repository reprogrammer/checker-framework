asmx.jar
  This jar is currently only used by
  checkers.util.stub.Skeleton
  I would like to get rid of this dependency and Skeleton.

javaparser.jar
  This file is not in the repository. It is rebuilt from the
  CF/javaparser project.

jna.jar
  This is used by CheckerMain to call a system execute instead
  of a pure Java solution. The comment says something about
  support for "redirects".
  Can we somehow get rid of this dependency?

Also note that there is ../tests/junit-4.7.jar, which
is used by the tests only.
