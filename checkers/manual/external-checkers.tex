\chapter{Third-party checkers\label{third-party-checkers}\label{external-checkers}}

The checker framework has been used to build other checkers that are not
distributed together with the framework.  This chapter mentions just a few
of them.
If you want a reference to your checker included in this chapter,
send us a link and a short description.


\section{Units and dimensions checker\label{units-and-dimensions-checker}}

A checker for units and dimensions is available at
\url{http://www.lexspoon.org/expannots/}.

Unlike the Units Checker that is distributed with the Checker Framework
(see Section~\ref{units-checker}), this checker includes dynamic checks and
permits annotation arguments that are Java expressions.  This added
flexibility, however, requires that you use a special version both of the
Checker Framework and of the Type Annotations compiler.


\section{Thread locality checker\label{loci-thread-locality-checker}}

Loci, a checker for thread locality, is available at
\url{http://www.it.uu.se/research/upmarc/loci/}.
Developer resources are available at the project page
\url{http://java.net/projects/loci/}.

\section{Safety-Critical Java checker\label{safety-critical-java-checker}}

A checker for Safety-Critical Java (SCJ, JSR 302) is available at

% Name: SCJ Checker
% WWW: http://sss.cs.purdue.edu/projects/oscj/checker/checker.html
% Source-Code Repository: http://code.google.com/p/scj-jsr302/

% Description: The SCJ Checker implements verification of a set of
% annotations defined by the Safety-Critical Java standard (JSR-302).
% The checker mainly focuses on proving memory safety of Java programs
% that use a region-based memory management.

\section{Generic Universe Types checker\label{gut-checker}}

A checker for Generic Universe Types, a lightweight ownership type
system, is available from
\url{http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~wmdietl/ownership/}.


\section{EnerJ checker\label{enerj-checker}}

A checker for EnerJ, an extension to Java that exposes hardware faults
in a safe, principled manner to save energy with only
slight sacrifices to the quality of service, is available from
\url{http://sampa.cs.washington.edu/sampa/EnerJ}.


\section{CheckLT taint checker\label{checklt-checker}}

CheckLT uses taint tracking to detect illegal information flows, such as
unsanitized data that could result in a SQL injection attack.
CheckLT is available from \url{http://checklt.github.io/}.
