\chapter{Integration with external tools\label{external-tools}}

This section discusses how to run a checker from your favorite IDE\@.

Or, if your favorite isn't here, you should customize how it runs the
javac command on your behalf.  See the IDE documentation to learn how to
customize it, adapting the instructions for javac in Section~\ref{running}.
If you make another tool support running a checker, please 
inform us via the
\ahref{http://groups.google.com/group/checker-framework-discuss}{mailing
  list} or
\ahref{http://code.google.com/p/checker-framework/issues/list}{issue tracker} so
we can add it to this manual.

This section also discusses type inference tools (see
Section~\ref{type-inference-tools}).


\section{Ant task\label{ant-task}}

If you use the \ahref{http://ant.apache.org/}{Ant} build tool to compile
your software, then you can add an Ant task that runs a checker.  We assume
that your Ant file already contains a compilation target that uses the
\code{javac} task.

First, set the \code{jsr308javac} property:

%BEGIN LATEX
\begin{smaller}
%END LATEX
\begin{Verbatim}
  <!-- Boilerplate to set jsr308javac property. Is there a better way? -->
  <property environment="env"/>
  <condition property="isUnix">
    <os family="unix" />
  </condition>
  <condition property="isWindows">
    <os family="windows" />
  </condition>
  <target name="init-jsr308javac-unix" if="isUnix">
    <property name="jsr308javac" value="${env.CHECKERS}/binary/javac" />
  </target>
  <target name="init-jsr308javac-windows" if="isWindows">
    <property name="jsr308javac" value="${env.CHECKERS}/binary/javac.bat" />
  </target>
\end{Verbatim}
%BEGIN LATEX
\end{smaller}
%END LATEX

\noindent
The \code{property} target makes environment variables (such as your home
directory) available to Ant.

Next, duplicate the compilation target, then modify it slightly as
indicated in this example, filling in each ellipsis (\ldots) from the
original compilation target:

%BEGIN LATEX
\begin{smaller}
%END LATEX
\begin{Verbatim}
  <target name="check-nullness"
          description="Check for nullness errors."
          depends="clean,...,init-jsr308javac-unix,init-jsr308javac-windows">
    <javac ...
           fork="yes"
           executable="${jsr308javac}">
      <compilerarg value="-version"/>
      <compilerarg line="-target 5"/>
      <compilerarg line="-processor checkers.nullness.NullnessChecker"/>
      <compilerarg line="-Xbootclasspath/p:${env.CHECKERS}/jdk/nullness/jdk.jar"/>
      <compilerarg value="-implicit:class"/>
      <compilerarg line="-Awarns -Xmaxwarns 10000"/>
      <classpath>
        <pathelement location="${env.CHECKERS}/checkers.jar"/>
        ...
      </classpath>
      ...
    </javac>
  </target>
\end{Verbatim}
%BEGIN LATEX
\end{smaller}
%END LATEX
% Unconfuse Emacs font lock mode: $

In the example, the target is named \code{check-nullness}, but you can
name it whatever you like.

The target assumes the existence of a \code{clean} target that removes all
\code{.class} files.  That is necessary because Ant's \code{javac} target
doesn't re-compile \code{.java} files for which a \code{.class} file
already exists.

The \code{executable} and \code{fork} fields of the \code{javac} task
ensure that an external javac program is called.  Otherwise, Ant will run
javac via a Java method call, and there is no guarantee that it will get
the JSR 308 version that is distributed with the Checker Framework.

The \code{-version} compiler argument is just for debugging; you may omit
it.

The \code{-target 5} compiler argument is optional, if you use Java 5 in
ordinary compilation when not performing pluggable type-checking.

The \code{-processor ...} compiler argument indicates which checker to
run.  You can supply additional arguments to the checker as well.

The \code{-implicit:class} compiler argument causes annotation processing
to be performed on implicitly compiled files.  (An implicitly compiled file
is one that was not specified on the command line, but for which the source
code is newer than the \code{.class} file.)  This is the default, but
supplying the argument explicitly suppresses a compiler warning.

The \code{-Awarns ...} compiler argument is optional, and causes the checker to
treat errors as warnings so that you can see all errors in all files rather
than only the errors in the first file; see Section~\ref{running}.


\section{Maven plugin\label{maven-plugin}}

If you use the \ahref{http://maven.apache.org/}{Maven} project tool,
then you can specify the distributed checkers as part of your build
process.

\begin{enumerate}

\item First, you need to add the repositories in your \code{pom.xml} file:

\begin{Verbatim}
    <repositories>  
        <repository>  
            <id>checker-framework-repo</id>  
            <url>http://types.cs.washington.edu/m2-repo</url>  
        </repository>  
    </repositories>  
    <pluginRepositories>  
        <pluginRepository>  
            <id>checker-framework-repo</id>  
            <url>http://types.cs.washington.edu/m2-repo</url>  
        </pluginRepository>  
    </pluginRepositories>
\end{Verbatim}

\item Then, to use the annotations used by the distributed checkers, you'll
have to declared as a dependency:

\begin{Verbatim}
    <dependencies>  
        <!-- annotations for the standard checkers: nullness, interning, mutability -->  
        <dependency>  
            <groupId>types.checkers</groupId>  
            <artifactId>checkers-quals</artifactId>  
            <version>1.0.6</version>  
        </dependency>  

        <!-- other dependencies -->  
    </dependencies>
\end{Verbatim}

\item And finally, you need to attach the plugin to your build lifecycle:

\begin{Verbatim}
    <build>  
        <plugins>  
            <plugin>  
                <groupId>types.checkers</groupId>  
                <artifactId>checkersplugin</artifactId>  
                <version>0.1</version>  
                <executions>  
                    <execution>  
                        <!-- run the checkers after compilation; this can also be any later phase -->  
                        <phase>process-classes</phase>  
                        <goals>  
                            <goal>check</goal>  
                        </goals>  
                    </execution>  
                </executions>  
                <configuration>  
                    <!-- required configuration options -->  
                    <!-- a list of processors to run -->  
                    <processors>  
                        <processor>checkers.nullness.NullnessChecker</processor>  
                        <processor>checkers.interning.InterningChecker</processor>  
                    </processors>  


                    <!-- other optional configuration -->  
                    <!-- full path to a java executable that should be used to create the forked JVM -->  
                    <executable>/opt/java1.6/bin/java</executable>  
                    <!-- should an error reported by a checker cause a build failure, or only be logged as a warning; defaults to true -->  
                    <failOnError>true|false</failOnError>  
                    <!-- a list of patterns to include, in the standard maven syntax; defaults to **/*.java -->  
                    <includes>  
                        <include>org/company/important/**/*.java</include>  
                    </includes>  
                    <!-- a list of patterns to exclude, in the standard maven syntax; defaults to an empty list -->  
                    <excludes>  
                        <exclude>org/company/notimportant/**/*.java</exclude>  
                    </excludes>  
                    <!-- additional parameters passed to the JSR308 java compiler -->  
                    <javacParams>-Alint</javacParams>  
                    <!-- additional parameters to pass to the forked JVM -->  
                    <javaParams>-Xdebug</javaParams>  
                    <!-- versions of checkers to use; defaults to the current newest version: 1.0.6 -->  
                    <checkersVersion>0.8.8</checkersVersion>    
                </configuration>  
            </plugin>  
        </plugins>  
    </build>
\end{Verbatim}

\end{enumerate}

\section{IntelliJ IDEA\label{intellij}}

IntelliJ IDEA (Maia release)
\ahref{http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2009/07/type-annotations-jsr-308-support/}{supports}
the Type Annotations (JSR-308) syntax.
See \url{http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2009/07/type-annotations-jsr-308-support/}.

\section{Eclipse\label{eclipse}}

There are two ways to run a checker from within the Eclipse IDE:  via Ant
or using an Eclipse plug-in.


\paragraph{Using an Ant task}

Add an Ant target as described in Section~\ref{ant-task}.  You can
run the Ant target by executing the following steps
(instructions copied from
\myurl{http://www.eclipse.org/documentation/?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-84_run_ant.htm}):

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Select \code{build.xml} in one of the navigation views and choose
  {\bf Run As $>$ Ant Build...} from its context menu.

\item
  A launch configuration dialog is opened on a launch configuration
  for this Ant buildfile.

\item
  In the {\bf Targets} tab, select the new ant task (e.g., check-interning).

\item
  Click {\bf Run}.

\item
  The Ant buildfile is run, and the output is sent to the Console view.

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Eclipse plug-in}

There are two choices for Eclipse support for type annotations.

A prototype Eclipse plug-in for running a checker is available at
\myurl{http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/eclipse/}.  
The website contains instructions for installing and using the plug-in.
The plug-in is
experimental now, but some people have used it successfully (and we have fixed
all bugs that have been reported so far).

Another prototype version of Type Annotations support for Eclipse is
available from the Eclipse project.  Use the following information to check
out the CVS repository:
\begin{description}
\item[Host:]                 dev.eclipse.org
\item[Repository path:] /cvsroot/eclipse
\item[Module name:]    org.eclipse.jdt.core
\item[Branch:]             JSR\_308
\end{description}

tIDE, an open-source Java IDE, supports the Checker Framework.  See its
documentation at \myurl{http://tide.olympe-network.com/}.


\section{Type inference tools\label{type-inference-tools}}

\subsection{Varieties of type inference}

There are two different tasks that are commonly called ``type inference''.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Type inference during type checking (Section~\ref{type-refinement}):
  During type checking, if certain variables have no type qualifier, the
  type-checker determines whether there is some type qualifier that would
  permit the program to type check.  If so, the type checker uses that type
  qualifier, but never tells the programmer what it was.  Each time the
  type checker runs, it re-infers the type qualifier for that variable.  If
  no type qualifier exists that permits the program to type-check, the
  type-checker issues a type warning.

  This variety of type inference is built into the Checker Framework.  Every
  checker can take advantage of it at no extra effort.  However, it only
  works within a method, not across method boundaries.

  Advantages of this variety of type inference include:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If the type qualifier is obvious to the programmer, then omitting it
    can reduce annotation clutter in the program.
  \item
    The type inference can take advantage of only the code currently being
    compiled, rather than having to be correct for all possible calls.
    Additionally, if the code changes, then there is no old annotation to
    update.
  \end{itemize}


\item
  Type inference to annotate a program (Section~\ref{type-inference-to-annotate}):
  As a separate step before type checking, a type inference tool takes the
  program as input, and outputs a set of type qualifiers that would
  type-check.  These qualifiers are inserted into the source code or the
  class file.  They can be viewed and adjusted by the programmer, and can
  be used by tools such as the type checker.

  This variety of type inference must be provided by a separate tool.  It
  is not built into the Checker Framework.

  Advantages of this variety of type inference include:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The program contains documentation in the form of type qualifiers,
    which can aid programmer understanding.
  \item
    Error messages may be more comprehensible.  With type inference
    during type checking, error messages can be obscure, because the
    compiler has already inferred (possibly incorrect) types for a number
    of variables.
  \item
    A minor advantage is speed:  type-checking can be modular, which can be
    faster than re-doing type inference every time the
    program is type-checked.
  \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

Advantages of both varieties of inference include:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Less work for the programmer.
\item
  The tool chooses the most general type, whereas a programmer might
  accidentally write a more specific, less generally-useful annotation.
\end{itemize}


Each variety of type inference has its place.  When using the Checker
Framework, type inference during type checking is performed only
\emph{within} a method (Section~\ref{type-refinement}).  Every method
signature (arguments and return values) and field must be explicitly annotated,
either by the programmer or by a separate type checking tool
(Section~\ref{type-inference-to-annotate}).  This choice reduces programmer
effort (typically, a programmer does not have to write any qualifiers
inside the body of a method) while still retaining modular checking and
documentation benefits.


\subsection{Type inference to annotate a program\label{type-inference-to-annotate}}

This section lists tools that take a program and output a set of
annotations for it.

Section~\ref{nullness-inference} lists several tools that infer
annotations for the Nullness Checker.

Section~\ref{javari-inference} lists a tool that infers
annotations for the Javari Checker, which detects mutation errors.
