\chapter{RegEx checker\label{regex-checker}}

The RegEx Checker implements a type-checker for a regular expression type
system.  A regex type system prevents, at compile-time, from using erroneous
regular expressions.

Regular Expressions are a mechanism to identify strings of text in a concise
and flexible manner.  Java supports regular expressions through the
\sunjavadoc{java/util/regex/Pattern.html}{Pattern} class.  The class
documentation explains the syntax and the format of such expressions.

The Checker also checks for unsupported RegEx features.  Java's
implementation and support has some notable differences from
other implementation, namely the Perl implementation.  This forms an
obstacle for Java-new-comers who are proficient in Perl.  The
\sunjavadoc{java/util/regex/Pattern.html}{Pattern} javadoc notes all
of these differences.  The RegEx Checker warns against these usages at
compile time as well.

\section{RegEx annotations}

The RegEx Checker uses one annotation only:
\code{@\refclass{regex}{ValidRegex}}, to indicate valid regular expression
\code{String}s.

The Checker implicitly adds the \code{ValidRegex} qualifier to all
regex \code{String} literals.
