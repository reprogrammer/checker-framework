Checker Framework redesign/refactoring:

* Document the difference between getAnnotation and getEffectiveAnnotation

* rename commonAssignmentCheck to subtypeCheck

* rename asMemberOf or postAsMemberOf to fieldFromUse

* isSubtype should not return boolean.
  (Sometimes it is used for control flow rather than error reporting?  Why?  And would that even be possible to incorporate into inference mode?)
  It should be "requireSubtype", return void, and issue the proper error.
  This is essentially commonAssignmentCheck, though.  What's the distinction?  Determine that and document it.
  An alternative (but not as good?):  isSubtype could return information about the specific error (like 3rd type parameter is the one that doesn't match, for example).
  Problem: type hierarchy doesn't have access to the Checker.
   * could return an error object, or pass in something that will handle errors.
  (Werner calls this a "declarative interface".)
  [Jonathan should propose an interface.]
  [Werner will write some code in the meanwhile to direct the discussion.]

* CF cleanups based on langtools cleanups -- typeFromElement and typeFromTree hacks can be removed [Werner]

* Some things need to happen only once ever, whereas others happen once per compilation method.
  Need a setup and teardown method (rather than typeProcessingOver, which is not called if there is a Java error or typechkecing error (but is called if there are warnings)).
  [Werner.]

* AnnotatedTypeFactory changes (Stuart); see below

* eliminate use of reflection in composing a type-checker from
  similarly-named classes; force this to be explicit

* change from AST visiting to CFG visiting, so that each type system doesn't
  have to implement special logic to infer where boxing, unboxing, and
  other desugarings occur.
  TypeVisitor or SourceVisitor should be over the CFG.
  This can be independent of Stuart's changes.
  Should the new interface be over the CFG too?

* there are currently multiple ways to obtain an error reporter and other
  global values.  Put these in a Checker Framework environment, and make all
  the code use a single consistent way to obtain them.  This will make the
  code easier to understand and will make mocking easier to do.

* staging for compound checkers:  ability to run multiple checkers within a
  single type system [Rene]

* staging of steps within a checker:  separate conceptually distinct tasks,
  such as implicits/defaults/flow/typevalidity/subtyping/customchecks.
  This can be done in twwo spages:two tasks:
   1.  Using the current AnnotatedTypeFactory's lazy approach to annotation,
       separate the current logic into individual steps, where each step is run
       successively on the current tree.
   2.  Abandon the lazy approach.  Separate the current logic into steps that
       are run over an entire compilation unit.  This is to avoid the visitor 
       feedback loop that makes debugging so difficult.  
  [Rene]

* separate definition of a type-checker from performing type-checking using
  that definition, to make "initialization" of a type system easier
* eliminate postInit method

* load javac via a classloader rather than by starting a new process -- this
  may avoid some problems with the Maven and Eclipse plugins?


* use a single Processor implementation and ensure checker writers never have
to worry about the Processor interface.  Invocation could be done a number of
ways:
javac --processor checkers.CheckerFramework -Acheckers:checker1:checker2:checker
javac --checkers checker1:checker2:checkers3 
By the way, the second option will work with both the jsr308 and Java8
compilers as the --checkers could be translated by CheckerMain into the first
form.  

===========================================================================

Inference-related tasks:

* Create unique ids for each annotated type location in source code, these IDs
will replace inference's ids.  This can be a discrete task, though I would
imagine there are some interactions with Stuart's code.   

* Add a callback for either generating constraints or enforcing checks in
either commonAssignmentCheck or QualifierHierarchy.  If this is done through
QualifierHierarchy, create methods isSubtype and mustBeSubtype to distinguish
between the the times when isSubtype is used in conditionals rather than to
enforce a subtype relationship

* Add a Solve step to the top-level control flow.  Perhaps, as part of the high
level staging this step can optionally be replaced by a PrintConstraints step,
or a GenerateGame step.

Overview of Stuart's refactorings, in his own words:

> The stuff I'm working on has three main components:
> 
>  - User-defined qualifier support: Allow checkers to use custom objects to
>    represent qualifiers internally, instead of using AnnotationMirrors
>    directly.
>  - Qualifier parameter support: Allow checkers to easily add support for
>    generics-style qualifier parameters.  This uses user-defined qualifiers in
>    its implementation.
>  - SPARTA: A new implementation of the SPARTA FlowChecker, based on qualifier
>    parameters.
> 
> Here are my branches:
> 
> ssh://tricycle/homes/gws/spernste/hg/checker-framework
>   (branched from checker-framework-dff)
>   This has changes to existing checker framework components that are necessary
>   to make the other components work.
> 
> ssh://tricycle/homes/gws/spernste/hg/checker-framework-qual
>   (branched from ~spernste/hg/checker-framework)
>   This has user-defined qualifier support, implemented as an abstract base
>   checker in the checkers.userqual package.  I also adapted the TaintingChecker
>   to use the new userqual base classes.
> 
> ssh://tricycle/homes/gws/spernste/hg/checker-framework-qualparam
>   (branched from ~spernste/hg/checker-framework-qual)
>   This has qualifier parameter support, implemented as an abstract base checker
>   in the checkers.qualparam package.  I also adapted the TaintingChecker to
>   use the new qualparam base classes.
> 
> ssh://tricycle/homes/gws/spernste/hg/checker-framework-sparta
>   (branched from ~spernste/hg/checker-framework-qualparam)
>   This has the qualparam-based implementation of the SPARTA FlowChecker.
> 
> I think I have the permissions set so anyone can check out from these
> repositories, but let me know if I need to fix them.
