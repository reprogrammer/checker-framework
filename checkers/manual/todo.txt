Necessary changes to the manual.  In brackets I (Stefan) wrote the names of people familiar with the particular change, which might be most qualified to make the change.  If no person is listed, than anyone could do the change.

New section on concepts and annotations that apply to all type-systems and checkers

Where would a good place be for this?  At the beginning/end?  Split into multiple sections?

- Pre-/postconditions from a user perspective:
  - Explain the generic pre- and postcondition annotations: @EnsuresAnnotation/@EnsuresAnnotations, @EnsuresAnnotationIf/@EnsuresAnnotationsIf and @RequiresAnnotation/@RequiresAnnotations.
  - Explain what kind of strings are supported (see text near the end of this documentat; use that to augment the existing Checker Framework documentation).

- Pre-/postconditions from a developer perspective:
  - Explain the meta-annotations @PreconditionAnnotation, @ConditionalPostconditionAnnotation and @PostconditionAnnotation.

- Dataflow analysis
  - Explain the command line parameter -Adotflowdir (probably find a better name first) [Stefan/Charlie].

- Document -ANullnessChecker_option=value mechanism

------------------------------------------------------

The Javadoc for DefaultQualifieers uses ALL_EXCEPT_LOCALS in an example.
Replace it and document how to achieve CLIMB-to-top instead.

------------------------------------------------------

Explain relationship between XXXChecker and XXXAnnotatedTypeFactory:
if the Checker is a subtype of BaseTypeChecker, the ATF has to be a
subtype of AbstractBasicATF, because BaseTypeVisitor assumes that.

We found a better naming scheme than Basic vs. Base; it needs to be documented.

[Stefan]

Explanations on what flow expressions are supported (i.e. strings in pre/postconditions):


------------------------------------------------------

Eclipse setup
-------------
Describe checker-framework.importorder and formatter.
Should these developer-focused configs be moved somewhere else?
