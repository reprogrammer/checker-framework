The following items most likely need to be updated or added to the checker manual:
- Explain the command line parameter -Adotflowdir (probably find a better name first).
- Explain the command line parameter -AsuggestPureMethods.
- Explain the generic pre- and postcondition annotations: @EnsuresAnnotation/@EnsuresAnnotations, @EnsuresAnnotationIf/@EnsuresAnnotationsIf and @RequiresAnnotation/@RequiresAnnotations.
- Explain the meta-annotations @PreconditionAnnotation, @ConditionalPostconditionAnnotation and @PostconditionAnnotation.
- Explain the new annotation @TerminatesExecution.
- Explain the new defaulting for local variables (including our decision on casts and instanceof).
- Update the new purity annotation @Pure (with the two version for determinitic methods and side-effect free methods).  It is now available for all type-systems, not just nullness.
