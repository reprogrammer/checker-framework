Necessary changes to the manual.  In brackets I (Stefan) wrote the names of people familiar with the particular change, which might be most qualified to make the change.  If no person is listed, than anyone could do the change.



New section on concepts and annotations that apply to all type-systems and checkers
===========================================================================
What would a good place be for this?  At the beginning/end?  Split into multiple sections?

- Purity annotation
  - Explain the annotation and its semantics (can probably mostly taken from the Javadoc of @Pure).
  - Explain the command line parameter -AsuggestPureMethods, as well as what the purity analysis does (again, see Javadoc of @Pure).
  - Explain the command line parameter -AenablePurity (maybe this ambiguous option, which enables checking whether method bodies are compatible with the method declaration annotation, should be renamed, such as to -AcheckPurity)

- Pre-/postconditions from a user perspective:
  - Explain the generic pre- and postcondition annotations: @EnsuresAnnotation/@EnsuresAnnotations, @EnsuresAnnotationIf/@EnsuresAnnotationsIf and @RequiresAnnotation/@RequiresAnnotations.
  - Explain what kind of strings are supported (see at the end of the documentation for a list).

- Pre-/postconditions from a developer perspective:
  - Explain the meta-annotations @PreconditionAnnotation, @ConditionalPostconditionAnnotation and @PostconditionAnnotation.

- Dataflow analysis
  - Explain the new defaulting for local variables (including our decision on casts and instanceof).
  - Explain the command line parameter -Adotflowdir (probably find a better name first) [Stefan/Charlie].
  - Explain the new annotation @TerminatesExecution.
  - Document -AconcurrentSemantics command-line option; also note it in caveats about what the checker guarantees [Stefan].
  - Document -AassumeAssertionsAreEnabled and -AassumeAssertionsAreDisabled [Stefan].

- Document @Covariant annotation [Mike/Werner].

- Document -AignoreRawTypeArguments (rename the option?)

- Document -ANullnessChecker_option=value mechanism

Changes throughout the manual to existing sections
===========================================================================

Document the lint option strictMonotonicNonNullInit for NullnessChecker (disallow null initializations for @MonoNonNull fields)

------------------------------------------------------

[Stefan]

After an expression has been unboxed, it is assumed to be non-null (if it was not, then a NPE has occured).  This prevents many errors for the same problem, just like there is only one error for "o.toString(); o.toString()".

------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------

"NNEL" default becomes "top for locals, casts, and instanceof"
The top qualifier should only be added to top-level type variables,
because those will get suitably refined by flow.
For type variables in other positions, e.g. as type argument in your
example, we should not add default qualifiers.

------------------------------------------------------

Explain relationship between XXXChecker and XXXAnnotatedTypeFactory:
if the Checker is a subtype of BaseTypeChecker, the ATF has to be a
subtype of AbstractBasicATF, because BaseTypeVisitor assumes that.

We found a better naming scheme than Basic vs. Base; it needs to be documented.

------------------------------------------------------

Difference between treatment of explicit and implicit bounds:
 * Whenever a bound is explicit, it should use the standard defaulting rules.
 * Whenever a bound is implicit, it should use the maximal type:  maximally
   high for an upper bound, and maximally low for a lower bound.
These rules are applied uniformly for type variables and wildcards.

------------------------------------------------------

[Stefan]

Explanations on what flow expressions are supported (i.e. strings in pre/postconditions):

- Flow expressions:  There is fairly good support for methods with arguments now.   In general, the following features work.
    - Field accesses of the form "expr.f" (for any flow expression "expr", including method calls or other field access expressions).
    - Static field accesses of the form "ClassName.f".
    - Pure method calls (with or without parameters) of the form "expr.method(arg1, arg2, ...).  This even works for overloaded methods and methods with type parameters.
    - Static pure method calls.
    - Self reference (i.e., "this").  It can be left off in which case the (static or non-static) field/method is searched for in the current class (just like in normal Java).  That is, both "f" and "this.f" work.
    - Parameters to the method that a contract annotation belongs, #1, #2, etc.
    - String literals, integer literals, long literals, null literal.
- Flow expressions limitations: There are some limitations that I'm aware of, but I don't think any of these are severe.  Let me know if you think we should include any of them.
    - Other literals, e.g. floats, doubles, chars or class literals.
    - String concatenation expressions.
    - Mathematical operators (plus, minus, division, ...).
    - Comparisons (equality, less than, etc.).
    - Probably other Java expressions that are "pure" (non-pure things cannot occur, anyway) that I did not think of.


Changelog
===========================================================================

Format String Checker (new):
  Ensures that format methods (such as System.out.printf) are invoked
  with correct arguments.

Renamed method annotations used by the Nullness Checker:
  @AssertNonNullAfter => @EnsuresNonNull
  @NonNullOnEntry => @RequiresNonNull
  @AssertNonNullIfTrue(...) => @EnsuresNonNullIf(result=true, expression=...)
  @AssertNonNullIfFalse(...) => @EnsuresNonNullIf(result=false, expression=...)
  @LazyNonNull => @MonotonicNonNull
  @AssertParametersNonNull => [no replacement]
Renamed method annotations used by all checkers:
  @SuppressWarnings => @AssumeAssertion

New -AonlyDefs and -AonlyUses command-line options complement existing
-AskipDefs and -AskipUses command-line options

New manual section about array types

Suppress warnings using assert statements with the string
@AssumeAssertion(warningkey); previously, just the warning key sufficed.

Purity analysis:  uses new annotations @SideEffectFree and ...


Eclipse setup
-------------
Describe checker-framework.importorder and formatter.
Should these developer-focused configs be moved somewhere else?
