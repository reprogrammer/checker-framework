While people get seated, have a slide up to encourage
people to get online and start downloading the CF and demos.

Intro and overview of JSR 308 and the Checker Framework
  Why we want pluggable type checkers
  JSR 308: will be in Java 8, built on OpenJDK, very stable
  CF: basic ideas
  Mike: 10 mins

ICSE case study as further motivation
  Werner: 15 mins

  Show the URL and get everyone moving
  Werner: 1 min

Interactive:
  Eclipse and command line installation
    hopefully less than 10 mins

  Personal blog demo:
    We provide the annotated source code and
    together walk through the problem and the solutions
    David: 10 mins

Writing a declarative checker: Signature Checker
  David: 5 mins

Brain-storming type systems with the participants:
  David continues and gives
  1st slide: List of distributed checkers.
  2nd slide: What are type system properties.
  All three of us will stand on stage and try to answer suggestions
  People suggest run-time errors that should be avoided and
  we try to find type qualifiers and a hierarchy that could be used.
  10 mins

Interactive:
  Either work on the newly developed type system (with their own code), or
  with an existing type checker on their own code with, or
  on the IRC demo.
