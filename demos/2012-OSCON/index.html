<h1>Tutorial: Preventing Runtime Errors at Compile Time with the Checker Framework</h1>

<p>
In this self-paced tutorial, you will learn to use the Checker Framework to
improve code quality.  In particular, the Checker Framework will give a
compile-time guarantee that certain run-time errors cannot occur.
</p>

<h2>Install the Checker Framework</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html#installation">Install
  the Checker Framework</a>.
</p>

<p>
Be sure that running <tt>javac -version</tt> produces an output string that
contains <tt>jsr308</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Follow the instructions for an
<a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html#example-use">example
  use</a> of the Nullness Checker.
</p>

<!--
<p>
The following instructions assume a <code>CHECKERS</code> environment
variable that is set to the
<code>checker-framework/checkers/</code> directory within
your Checker Framework installation, but you can use absolute pathnames
instead.
</p>
-->


<h2>Find missing input validation</h2>

<p>
We will find and correct errors in how the 
<a href="Search.java">Search.java</a>.
application uses regular expressions.
Currently, when the user provides invalid inputs, the program crashes with
a stack trace, which is offputting and uninformative to users.
The <tt>Search.java</tt> application is incorrect in that it does not
validate user input.  You will correct this problem.
</p>

<p>
Download <a href="Search.java">Search.java</a>.
</p>

<p>
Type check <tt>Search.java</tt> by running the following command, using the
Checker Framework's <tt>javac</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
javac -processor org.checkerframework.checker.regex.RegexChecker Search.java
</pre>

<p>
The Regex Checker finds the error &mdash; the missing validation.  Correct
the problem by adding proper validation, and verify that your solution is
correct by re-running the Regex Checker until it issues no errors.
</p>

<p>
<b>TODO:  Give away the answer, by supplying a link that gives the missing
  validation lines, for use by users who get stuck.</b>
</p>



<h2>Write an Encryption Checker</h2>

<p>
You will write your own declarative type checker to ensure
encrypted communication!
</p>

<p>
Demo application: <a href="EncryptionDemo.java">EncryptionDemo.java</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the session we will write a new Encrypted annotation.
You compile it like any other Java class:
</p>

<pre>
javac .../Encrypted.java
</pre>

<p>
You then use the Subtype Checker to check the demo program, like so:
<p>

<pre>
$CHECKERS/bin/javac -processor org.checkerframework.common.subtype.SubtypeChecker -Aquals=encrypted.quals.Encrypted .../EncryptionDemo.java
</pre>

<p>
[It is sometimes necessary to provide the location of the annotation
class on the bootclasspath. Use the "-Xbootclasspath/p:yourpath"
parameter for this.]
</p>


<h2>Find a security error in the Personal Blog project</h2>

<p>
As a first demonstration, we will use the
Personal Blog demonstration.
You can download the
<a href="personalblog-demo.zip">project here</a>.
Unzip it into a directory.
An Ant build file is there.
In Eclipse, you can import the folder as a new project.
</p>



<h2>Abstract of the tutorial</h2>

<p>
A pluggable type system extends a language's built-in type system to
confer additional compile-time guarantees.  We will explain the theory and
practice of pluggable types.  The material is relevant for researchers who
wish to apply type theory, and for anyone who wishes to increase confidence
in their code.  After this session, you will have the knowledge to:
analyze a problem to determine whether pluggable type-checking is
appropriate; design a domain-specific type system; implement a simple
type-checker (in as little as 4 lines of code!); scale a simple
type-checker to more sophisticated properties; and better appreciate both
object-oriented types and flexible verification techniques.
</p>

<p>
While the theory is general, our hands-on exercises will use a
state-of-the-art system, the Checker Framework, that works for the Java
language, scales to millions of lines of code, and is being adopted in the
research and industrial communities.  Such a framework enables researchers
to easily evaluate their type systems in the context of a widely-used
industrial language, Java.   It enables non-researchers to verify their
code in a lightweight way and to create custom analyses.  And it enables
students to better appreciate type system concepts.
</p>

<p>We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>guide the audience through installing the Checker Framework,
  including how to set up Eclipse integration;</li>
<li>teach how to use some of the checkers included with the Checker
  Framework;</li>
<li>discuss other types of errors that one would like to be prevented at
  compile time;</li>
<li>and teach how to write a new type checker to prevent the errors we
  come up with in our discussion.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Audience participation is desired! We expect the audience to come
prepared with a laptop with a working Java environment (Eclipse
optional).
