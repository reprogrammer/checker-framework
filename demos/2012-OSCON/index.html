<h1>Tutorial: Preventing Runtime Errors at Compile Time</h1>

<p>
This is the companion site to our
<a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/schedule/detail/24366">OSCON session</a>.
</p>


<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
A pluggable type system extends a language's built-in type system to
confer additional compile-time guarantees.  We will explain the theory and
practice of pluggable types.  The material is relevant for researchers who
wish to apply type theory, and for anyone who wishes to increase confidence
in their code.  After this session, you will have the knowledge to:
analyze a problem to determine whether pluggable type-checking is
appropriate; design a domain-specific type system; implement a simple
type-checker (in as little as 4 lines of code!); scale a simple
type-checker to more sophisticated properties; and better appreciate both
object-oriented types and flexible verification techniques.
</p>

<p>
While the theory is general, our hands-on exercises will use a
state-of-the-art system, the Checker Framework, that works for the Java
language, scales to millions of lines of code, and is being adopted in the
research and industrial communities.  Such a framework enables researchers
to easily evaluate their type systems in the context of a widely-used
industrial language, Java.   It enables non-researchers to verify their
code in a lightweight way and to create custom analyses.  And it enables
students to better appreciate type system concepts.
</p>


<h2>Tutorial format</h2>

<p>We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>guide the audience through installing the Checker Framework,
  including how to set up Eclipse integration;</li>
<li>teach how to use some of the checkers included with the Checker
  Framework;</li>
<li>discuss other types of errors that one would like to be prevented at
  compile time;</li>
<li>and teach how to write a new type checker to prevent the errors we
  come up with in our discussion.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Audience participation is desired! We expect the audience to come
prepared with a laptop with a working Java environment (Eclipse
optional).
</p>


<p>
During our tutorial, we will use the Checker Framework.
For the command-line setup, see the <a
 href="../current/checkers-manual.html#installation">installation
instructions and tutorial</a> in the Checker Framework manual.<br/>
After following those, set the <code>CHECKERS</code> environment variable to the
<code>checker-framework/checkers/</code> directory within
your Checker Framework installation.
</p>

<h3>Regular Expression Checker demonstration</h3>

<p>
Demo application: <a href="Search.java">Search.java</a>.
</p>

<p>
After installing the Checker Framework, type check this
application by running:
</p>

<pre>
$CHECKERS/binary/javac -processor checkers.regex.RegexChecker Search.java
</pre>


<h3>Encryption Checker demonstration</h3>

<p>
You will write your own declarative type checker to ensure
encrypted communication!
</p>

<p>
Demo application: <a href="EncryptionDemo.java">EncryptionDemo.java</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the session we will write a new Encrypted annotation.
You compile it like any other Java class:
</p>

<pre>
$CHECKERS/binary/javac .../Encrypted.java
</pre>

<p>
You then use the Basic Checker to check the demo program, like so:
<p>

<pre>
$CHECKERS/binary/javac -processor checkers.basic.BasicChecker -Aquals=encrypted.quals.Encrypted .../EncryptionDemo.java
</pre>

<p>
[It is sometimes necessary to provide the location of the annotation
class on the bootclasspath. Use the "-Xbootclasspath/p:yourpath"
parameter for this.]
</p>


<h3>Personal Blog demonstration</h3>

<p>
As a first demonstration, we will use the
Personal Blog demonstration.
You can download the
<a href="personalblog-demo.zip">project here</a>.
Unzip it into a directory.
An Ant build file is there.
In Eclipse, you can import the folder as a new project.
