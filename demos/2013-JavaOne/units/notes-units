Preparation:  mv -f Projectile.java-orig Projectile.java

Explain the program.

The program compiles fine:
  javac Projectile.java

Now use pluggable type-checking:
  javac -processor checkers.units.UnitsChecker Projectile

Consider a velocity of 100 m/s and a launch angle of
45 degrees = pi/4 radians:

projectileRange(100, pi/4) = 1020
projectileRange(10, 45 /* incorrectly using degrees instead */) = 912

Thus, if you ran isSafelyDownRange to check if 10 meters is a safe distance,
but you used 45 degrees instead of pi/4 radians, you would be told it is safe
when it is in fact not safe.
