Build your own type system for fun and profit

Are you tired of null pointer exceptions, unintended side effects, SQL
injections, concurrency errors, mistaken equality tests, and other run-time
errors that appear during testing or in the field?

This talk will tell you about easy-to-use tools that guarantee the absence
of these and many other important errors.  You will also learn how to
create a new tool that detects and prevents other run-time errors --
whatever errors are important in your own project.  The tools are easy to
use and can be applied to as much or as little of your codebase as you feel
appropriate.  You can use them today, but Java 8's type annotations add
syntactic support for them.

===========================================================================

The presentation will describe the theory and practice of pluggable type-checking with concrete examples.  It will show real bugs that have been discovered and show the effort that is required.  It will give a way of thinking about what problems are amenable to this approach and what problems are not.  It will tie this to the type annotations feature that will appear in Java 8.  It will describe a practical toolset that attendees can start using today, even before Java 8 is released.

Are you tired of null pointer exceptions, unintended side effects, SQL

use and can be applied to as much or as little of your codebase as you feel
appropriate.  You can use them today, but Java 8's type annotations add
syntactic support for them.

The new tools work by creating a pluggable type system.  A pluggable type
system augments the built-in type system of Java, enabling better
compile-time guarantees.  We will explain what a pluggable type system is,
how to use it, and even how to create your own.  Building upon the Checker
Framework (http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/), you can
create a simple pluggable type-checker in 2 minutes, and you can enhance it
thereafter.

The pluggable types are easy to use, even for novices.  They are much less
verbose than generics, and they actually reduce the size of your code by
replacing English text in Javadoc by terse, formally-verified annotations.
They have found hundreds of bugs in over 3 million lines of well-tested
open source code, including from Oracle, Google, Apache, etc.  In addition
to finding bugs, they encourage better software design.

===========================================================================

Objective 1:
Learn how a compiler can detect and prevent run-time errors, beyond the built-in Java type system.

Objective 2:
Learn how to express domain-specific design properties formally, and guarantee their correctness.

Objective 3:
Learn about practical open-source tools for code quality.

Michael D. Ernst is the specification co-lead for Java's Type Annotations feature ("JSR 308"), which was awarded the ``most innovative JSR'' award in 2007.  Ernst was honored as a ``Java Rock Star'' for a crowd-pleasing JavaOne presentation.

Ernst is also an Associate Professor in the Computer Science & Engineering department at the University of Washington.  His research aims to make software more reliable, more secure, and easier (and more fun!) to produce. His primary technical interests are in software engineering and related areas, including programming languages, type theory, security, program analysis, bug prediction, testing, and verification. Ernst's research combines strong theoretical foundations with realistic experimentation, with an eye to changing the way that software developers work.

Dr. Ernst was previously a tenured professor at MIT, and before that a researcher at Microsoft Research.

Submission Information
An Oracle.com user account is required to submit a paper. If you do not have an account already, you will be prompted to create one before submitting. Once you create your account, you'll be taken to the login page for the Call for Papers portal. If at any time you forget your user name and password, simply select the "Retrieve/Forgot Password or Username" option.

Notes

Every time you log into the Call for Papers portal, you will see all papers you have submitted during the 2012 Call for Papers time frame.
While Call for Papers is open, you may go back and edit your previously submitted sessions.
At any point while submitting a session, you may stop and save your submission to complete at a later time. If you stop and save before your submission is complete (before all mandatory fields are answered), your submission will be given a status of "partial." You can go back and edit this session while Call for Papers is open.
Don't forget to save after each new submission or submission update.
Take note of your confirmation number after each submission. If you have any questions or concerns, you will want to include that confirmation number.
We will not accept any late submissions.
