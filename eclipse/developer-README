Checker Framework Eclipse Plugin

Included below are the development instructions for the checker framework eclipse plugin.
For general user instructions, see the homepage at:
http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/eclipse


Prerequisites: checkers.jar, checkers-quals.jar, jsr308-all.jar, javac.jar, and jdk.jar.  Some of these are redundant (and will be removed in the future).
These are all available from the checker-framework and jsr308 projects
respectively. For instructions on building these, see the documentation for
the Checker Framework and jsr308 (section 25.3).

You must put the above libraries in the lib folder (create one if missing)
in the checker-plugin folder.

==== Opening the Plugin Project ====
Eclipse has a nice set of tools for working with OSGI plugins.  To import the projects into your workspace use:
File->Import
Select the eclipse directory
Select all three projects



==== Debugging/Running the plugin ====

Since the plugin requires all the jars in the lib directory to be on the class path, if it's installed via the update-site (discussed below) then the plugin jar will be extracted into the plugins directory.  Unfortunately, this leads to a slightly different directory layout then the project directory (the bin/classes/checkers dir becomes a top level dir).  This means that the classpath used when the plugin is run as an actual plugin is different then the one needed to run the plugin from the eclipse project.  So (for now anyways), you must copy the bin/classes/checkers to checker-framework-eclipse-plugin if you want to run the plugin using the following instructions:
  
open the checker-framework-eclipse-plugin project in Eclipse. Click on the
plugin.xml and use the "run" action in Eclipse, which should open a dialog
where you can select "Run as Eclipse Application" or "Debug as Eclipse Application".

==== Packaging the feature ====
Note: If you are releasing you will want to follow the instructions in Updating the release version first.

To package the feature, open site.xml then click the "build all" button to have Eclipse build the jar files for the update-site. I usually have eclipse clean all three checker-framework-eclipse projects before doing this. 

This will create a working update site. You can upload this to a web server
to let users install the plugin from Eclipse's plugin installation process.

See next section (Updating the version)

==== Updating the release version ====

The plugin should be released simultaneously with the checker-framework therefore, since the plugin includes the checker-framework jars, the plugin feature version should be updated every release.

To update the version:
If the checker-framework-eclipse-plugin project has changed increment it's version by opening plugin.xml in Eclipse and selecting the "Overview" tab.

Next go to the checker-framework-eclipse-feature project and open the feature.xml.  If you have changed the plugin version, go to the "Plug-ins" tab and remove the old version and add the new version.  Then go to the "Overview" tab and increment the feature version to be the same as the upcoming Checker-Framework-Release.   

Next open the checker-framework-eclipse-update-site and select the site-map tab.  Press the arrow to view the features included in the checker.framework.eclipse.update.site.category.  Remove the only one there (it should be the previous version of the checker.framework.eclipse.feature.  Add the new checker.framework.eclipse.feature by selecting the category and pressing New Feature.  Select the new version of the feature you just made.


==== For UW's website ====

The checker plugin is uploaded to folder named:
  /cse/www2/types/checker-framework/checker-plugin/update-site-foo
where foo is a descriptive string (the current date works)

Update the symbolic link in the checker-plugin folder on the server to link
  update-site -> update-site-foo

This completes the process needed to upload a new update site in general.

If the checker framework/JSR308 jars were updated, upload those to the
lib folder in the checker-plugin folder mentioned above.

The checker-plugin folder on the server and its descendant folders/files should
be set to permissions 775.

==== Miscellaneous Dev Notes ====

The following notes outline small small things that disproportionally slowed me down

You probably want to download the RCP version if you want to be sure there will be no missing development plugins (though I got it working in 4.2 without doing this).

Eclipse likes to cache everything.  Even if you told eclipse to uninstall the plugin it will hold it in it's plugin directory for later and merely remove the feature from the installation.  This means, if you don't bump the version number when you are testing a version of the plugin then it will use the old version it has cached rather than downloading the new version from the update site.  Futhermore, even if you delete the plugin folder from the plugin directory it keeps a record in artifact.xml of the plugin's existence and will throw an exception when you try to download the plugin again if you do not remove that record.  Finally, sometimes, even if I deleted the feature, plugin, and edited the artifact.xml the menu extensions for the old plugin would still appear using the new plugin.  Therefore, my suggested workflow is to just keep a "GOLD" copy of eclipse that does not have the plugin installed in it.  And every time you have a new plugin version to work with (after you have tested it just using your development environment) do one last test on a clean version of eclipse with no plugin installed.

Note that in Eclipse 3.7 I ran into a problem where, when I checked "Unpack this jar", the output plugin.xml remained unchanged.  You must manually set unpack=true.

When generating the update site it would be wise to tell the Eclipse IDE to clean the plugin and update site first.
