The following simple commands allow you to build the plugin, install it locally, and install it to a repository.

To build the plugin:

mvn clean package

To install the plugin locally:

mvn install

To install the plugin to a repository:
    //Install the plugin locally
    mvn install
    
    //deploy it to a location
    mvn deploy:deploy-file \
    -DartifactId=checkersplugin \         
    -Dfile=<your path>/jsr308/checker-framework/maven-plugin/target/checkers-maven-plugin-<latest-version>.jar \        
    -Dversion=<latest-version> \
    -Durl=file://<your path>/maven/m2-repo \
    -DgroupId=types.checkers \
    -Dpackaging=jar \
    -DpomFile=<your path>/jsr308/checker-framework/maven-plugin/pom.xml \
    -DgeneratePom=false \

Note:  Before releasing the plugin you should update the default plugin version in the plugin and manual.

To update the default plugin version:
Open the "CheckersMojo.java" file and find the member variable "checkersVersion".
Change the default value from the current version to the next version for deployment.
There are now also pom files for all the artifacts of the checker-framework in $CHECKERS/binary/poms.
These must have the versions updated and deployed in the release.

To update the manual:
TODO: Make this automatic.
Open manual/external-tools.tex change the checker-framework version to the upcoming checker-framework version and change the maven plugin version to the new plugin version.
