    This document explains how to make a release of the Checker Framework, the Type Annotations Compiler,
    and the Annotation File Utilities.  In general the process consists of 4 steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Log into Buffalo.</li>
    <li>Download the release scripts.</li>
    <li>Run the build script.</li>
    <li>Run the push script.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The two scripts mentioned above are mostly self-explanatory but if this is the first time you have
    run the release script you probably want to look through this guide.
</p>
<p>
    Together, the release_build/release_push scripts probably take 1.5 hours (including manual steps).
    However, the most lengthy steps are automatic so you will be able to work on other tasks.

    <h2>Release Process Overview</h2>
    <p>The release process consists of running two scripts, release_build.py and release_push.y,
        and a few manual steps (prompted by the release scripts).  However, before releasing, it would be beneficial
        to first understand the structure of the projects on disk on Buffalo.</p>

                    release before we have made any irreversible changes.  Then, when the release
                    is validated, all we do is run &quot;hg push&quot; on all of the repos in interm.

                    test various components.

                    <strong>1a: Clean Repositories</strong><br/>
                    Recall that there are 3 relevant sets of repositories
                    for the release:<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>build repository - repository where the project is built for release</li>
                        <li>intermediate repository - repository to which release related changes are pushed after the project is built</li>
                        <li>release repository - Google code repositories, the central repository.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    Every time we run release_build, changes are committed to the intermediate repository
                    from build but NOT to the release repositories.  If we are running the build script multiple
                    times without actually committing the release then these changes need to be cleaned before we run the release_build script again.
                    We therefore run hg strip, hg purge, and hg revert on ALL repositories. <br/> <br/>
                    <p class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Note:</strong> See <a href="#fi_bug_fixes">Bug Fixes</a> for
                        errors you might experience at this step.

                    <strong>1b: Update repositories</strong><br/>
                    The repositories that were cleaned of changes in the previous step need to be updated to
                    the latest revision.  The intermediate repos pull from the release repos and the build repos
                    pull from the intermediate. All repos are then updated.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span style="float: right;" class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-close"></span>
                    <strong>1c: Verify repositories.</strong><br/>
                    This step ensures the previous 2 steps work.  It checks to see if we have any modified files,
                    untracked files, or outgoing changesets.  If so, it fails.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span style="float: right;" class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open"></span>
                    <strong>1d: Optionally replace files.</strong><br/>
                    You may wish to experiment with the build (for instance testing changes before
                    committing them to the repository).  The above 3 steps will revert any of those
                    changes you previously wrote the build repositories.  At this step, the script
                    pauses to allow you to replace any files you wish before actually executing the build.

            <strong>Build Step 2: Check tools.</strong><br/>
            The release script requires a number of common tools (Ant, Maven, make, etc...).
            This step checks to make sure all tools are available on the command line in order
            to avoid wasting time in the event a tool is missing late in execution.

            <strong>Build Step 3: Determine release versions.</strong><br/>
            Usually we increment the release by 0.0.1 per release unless there is a major
            change.  The release script will read the current version of the Checker Framework/Annotation File Utilities
            from the release website and then suggest the next release version 0.0.1 higher
            than the current version.  You can also manually specify a version higher than
            the current version.  Lower or equivalent versions are not possible and
            will be rejected when you try to push the release.
            <br/> <br/>
            The JSR308-Langtools version ALWAYS matches the Checker Framework version.

            <strong>Build Step 4: Verify changelogs.</strong><br/>
            All changelogs should be up to date before releasing.  However, we manually verify this
            during the build process.  This step extracts the changesets that have occurred
            since the last release and write them to a file.  Please look through these changesets and
            ensure we have not missed any relevant messages in the changelog.  The release script will
            indicate what changelog you should edit in case there are missing changes.  These changes
            will be committed when you run the release_push.py script.<br/><br/>
            Also, please verify that all changelog messages follow the guidelines found in:<b/>

            and Checker Framework.  Furthermore, their manuals and websites are also built and placed in their
            relevant locations at <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/dev/">http://types.cs.washington.edu/dev/</a>
            This is the most time consuming piece of the release.  There are no prompts from this

            Each project has a set of files that are updated for release.  Usually these updates
            include new release date and version information.  All changed files are committed and
            pushed to the intermediate repositories.  Keep this in mind if you have any

            Once staging is complete, there are manual steps to log into Sonatypes Central
            and &quot;close&quot; the staging repository.  Closing allows us to test the

            This step deploys the artifacts to the Central repository and prompts the user to

            live site (the previous release).  After step 5, these links point to the current release

    <h2>Changelog Guidelines</h2>
    <p> Each developer is responsible for updating project changelogs to reflect changes they
        have made each month.  The changelogs should be updated by "feature freeze" though at the
        latest this should be done before "code freeze".  Before releasing, the person performing
        the release will be asked to verify the changelogs (see Build Step 4).  Please check that
        there aren't typos (i.e. missing release date/version information, spelling errors, etc...).
        Also check that the changelog obeys the guidelines below.

    <section id="content_guidelines">
        <h3>Content Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Only (and all) changes that affect users go into the changelog.
                If a change is breaking, no matter how small, mention it.</li>
            <li>List all issues (in Google Code issue trackers) resolved in this release.  There is a step
                in the release that asks you to change all &quot;Pushed&quot; issues to &quot;Fixed&quot;; these
                issues should all be included in the changelog.  Search for the word &quot;issues&quot; in the
                changelog to see an example
            </li>

            <li>You may need to be aware of projects for which we don't want an announcement.  For instance,
                the GuiEffectsChecker was added a few months before we finished writing a manual section for it.
                We did not announce it until this section was written.  If you have questions, ask the relevant
                developer whether or not something should be mentioned.

    <section id="style_guidelines">
        <h3>Style Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Changes are written from the user's perspective.  Don't include implementation details that users
                don't care about.
            </li>
            <li>To be consistent, write in the past tense (e.g. &quot;Added option for verbose error messages&quot;).</li>
            <li>Don't exceed the 80 character limit.</li>
            <li>Break the different programs into their own sections.  See notes on release 1.7.0 and 1.5.0 for an
                example.  Things like the Eclipse plugin and Maven plugin should have their own section within the
                Checker Framework release notes (excluding issue fixes from the issue tracker).
            </li>
            <li>Be specific.  Don't write something like "added a few options to Eclipse plugin".  Do write "added

    <h2>Backing Out an Uncommitted Release</h2>
    <p>At the time of this writing, there are 2 steps that cannot be reverted.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The push from the interm repositories to the Google Code (release) repositories</li>
        <li>The release of the staged Maven artifacts</li>
    </ol>
    <p> If you have executed either of these steps and then realized there is a breaking error.  You should do another
        release.  The release script will allow you to do a point release like &quot;1.8.0.1&quot; when a version
        &quot;1.8.0&quot; already exists.<br/>
        <br/>
        If you have NOT committed an irreversible step then you can
        follow the steps below to point the live release to a previous release.  You can then redo the original
        release.  Make sure to say &quot;yes&quot; when the release script asks you to delete the old directories.
    </p>
    <h3>Manual Steps to Back Out a Release</h3>
    <ul id="backing_out_steps">
        <li><strong>Point symlinks to old release</strong><br/>
            For each project (JSR308, Annotation File Utilities, Checker Framework), find the
            version for the previous release. <br/>
            In each project's top-level website directory: (e.g. /cse/www2/types/checker-framework )
            delete the symlink &quot;current&quot; (or use the force option of ln) and point it to the
            release directory of the previous release.  E.g.<br/>
            <code>ln -sf /cse/www2/types/checker-framework/releases/1.7.5 /cse/www2/types/checker-framework/current</code>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Drop the artifacts from Central</strong><br/>
            You may have staged and then closed the artifacts in the Sonatypes Central repository.  Drop (do NOT release)
            these artifacts.  See

        <li><strong>Drop the Maven Artifacts from our Maven repo *** currently unneeded ***</strong>
            <p class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Note:</strong> The procedure below is NOT recommended
                by the Maven developers guide.  However, if done carefully and quickly no harm will likely
                come.  If people end up with out-of-date artifacts, recommend to them that they use the -U option
                in Maven 3.  Never follow these instructions if the plugin release has been publicized or
                existed for a while.
            </p>

            At the moment, we have decided to drop the user of our local Maven repository in favor of using
            the Central repository exclusively.  This may not be the case in the future.  If we do have a
            local repository, you need to go into the repositories directory (usually an m2-repo directory) and
            manually delete the versions of the Maven artifacts.  For instance, for the artifacts checker and compiler
            using version 0.9.8, I would delete the directories:
            <ul>
                <li>.../m2-repo/org/checkerframework/checker/0.9.8</li>
                <li>.../m2-repo/org/checkerframework/compiler/0.9.8</li>
            </ul>
            Furthermore, I would grep the files in the parents of these directories and ensure the version number
            does not appear in any metadata.  If so, fix up the metadata.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Note:</strong> You may find yourself copying release directories for some
        reason or other.  It is important to remember that the symlinks may be absolute.  You should check any
        symlinks that may be affected by the move and ensure they point to the new location and not the old one.

    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <p>Below is a roughly priority-ordered list of future improvements.  In a perfect world we would do
        all of these.  At the moment, I believe only the first 3 (Bug Fixes, Open JDK Javadoc Fixes,
        and More Sanity Checks) should have any appreciable priority.
    </p>

    <section id="fi_bug_fixes">
        <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
        The only known bug at the moment is a failed 'hg strip' that happens once in a while when the script is
        cleaning the build/interm repositories.  Running the script a few times clears this.  It happens at the
        beginning of the script so this doesn't take long but it would be good to figure out why the command
        fails and fix it up.

        The cause seems to be the following:
        <ol>
            <li>A release_build is performed but not pushed to Google code.  Lets say the number for the parent
            commit of this release is 1 and the commit for the release itself is 2a.
            </li>
            <li>One or more pushes are made to the Google Code repositories.  That makes the Google code have
                a commit 2b which is a child of 1.
            </li>
            <li>When we try to strip the changeset 2a, for some reason it works but outputs NO text to
                standard out and has a return status of 0.  Perhaps we should just expect this behavior as
                one of the valid outputs of strip.  We check to make sure there are no outgoing or uncommitted
                changes before building anyways.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Open JDK/JSR308 Javadoc</h3>
        Generating the Javadocs for the entire JDK is not simple.  We have previously generated these but have
        not updated them in a while.  They can be found here:<br/>
        <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/jdk-api/">http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/jdk-api/</a><br/>
        When we generate javadoc for the Type Annotations Compiler and Checker Framework we link against these docs.
        But because they were generated in a faulty manner in the first place, there are many broken links related to
        package summaries of the jdk-api docs.  It is highly unlikely that users will ever run into these links, since
        they occur in pages like Swing's package summary, but nonetheless it would be good to build these docs
        in the proper manner with no broken links.
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Figure out the best way to build the Open JDK Javadoc.</li>
            <li>Add a release script step to build the Open JDK Javadoc.</li>
            <li>Add a release script step to copy this javadoc to /cse/www2/types/checker-framework/jdk-api.</li>
            <li>We may also want to put jdk-api into the release directory instead of overwriting it during each release.</li>

    <section id="fi_more_sanity_checks">
        <h3>More Sanity Checks</h3>
        There are likely more sanity checks we might want to run during the release process.  One such example
        would be running the tutorial from the command line.  Another would be running the maven plugin using
        the released artifacts rather than the staged artifacts.
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement one of the sanity checks mentioned in this section.</li>
            <li>Add your sanity check to the appropriate location in the release_push script.</li>

        <h3>Buffalo Integration</h3>
        If we could have Buffalo run the release_build script nightly, we could head off broken links and other
        release related errors.  There is an &quot;--auto&quot; option for this specific reason but a number of
        errors start happening when we run the script from Buffalo.
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a Buffalo task to run the release_buld script using the &quot;--auto&quot; option.</li>
            <li>Observe the output of this task and identify possible errors.</li>
            <li>Fix up all observed errors until the release_build script runs without error.</li>
            <li>We probably want to move the link checking of the development site to the release_build script and
                write it out to disk.  This will allow the developer releasing the framework to consult pre-made
                link-checking results rather than waiting for the link checker to execute in the push script.

        <h3>Auto-copy Release Scripts</h3>
        The first step in running the release process, after the pre-release checklist, is to copy the
        release scripts into the jsr308-release directory.  We could automate this.
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a read-only script in jsr308-release/scripts.</li>
            <li>Edit the script so that it downloads all release scripts into the jsr308-release directory.</li>

    <section id="fi_option_parsing">
        <h3>Option Parsing</h3>
        There is currently some primitive option parsing written into the release scripts.  We should use
        Python's built in option parsing library.  There are multiple built-in libraries.  Please use the latest one.
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Look up the latest Python parsing library.</li>
            <li>Replace the option parsing in the release_build.py and release_push.py scripts with library calls.</li>

    <section id="fi_option_projects">
        <h3>Optional Projects</h3>
        A user might want to test the release_build script only on a specific project.  Some work has gone into
        the ability to select a project to build.  However, this currently doesn't take into consideration of dependencies.
        It might be more hassle than it's worth to implement this feature.  We should either complete the implementation
        or remove the partial implementation that already exists.  See <a href="#fi_repl_mode">REPL Mode</a>.
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve option parsing to allow the user to select only certain projects to build.</li>
            <li>Improve scripts to resolve dependencies between projects and only buidl the selected projects and
                their dependencies.

        </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="fi_repl_mode">
        <h3>REPL Mode</h3>
        The current script is built in an imperative style with little use of object orientation.  This imrpovement
        would create methods or objects that further encapsulate the current set of steps.  We could then provide
        an easy way to execute these steps from the Python REPL.  This would allow the user to execute individual steps
        in whatever order they saw fit from the Python REPL.  This could also be used to
        automatically back out the current release or the ability to edit/debug the release steps more easily.
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Further separate the steps of the release process.</li>
            <li>Provide a default parameterization for these steps to make them easily runnable from the
                command line. </li>
            <li>Provide a script to launch Python with these commands on its path.</li>

        <h3>Automate the Eclipse Build</h3>
        The Checker Framework Eclipse plugin is the cause of the most burdensome manual steps in the release
        process.  There exists ways to automate the plugin build and tests.  However, the process is complicated and
        would take a while to perfect.  It may or may not be worth it.
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Use Ant or other methods to automate the Eclipse build.</li>
            <li>Add to the release script targets for updating version numbers and other relevant fields
